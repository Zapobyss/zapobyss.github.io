    <p>In a nutshell, I made this core as an answer to popular metagame trends, such as Dragon Types and Physical attackers.</p>

    <h2>Info</h2>
    <p><strong>Mawile</strong> can check many Fairy type attackers with Iron Head such as Clefable and Sylveon. It has Play Rough for Dragon, Fighting and Dark types, Swords Dance for either setting up on predicted switches from the opponent or to offset the halved Attack from Will-o-Wisp and Sucker Punch for valuable priority. Having the highest Attack stat in the game lets Mega-Mawile act as a wallbreaker.</p>
    <p><strong>Uxie</strong> can be used as a Swiss Army knife to check a wide array of physical attackers, such as Mega-Kangaskhan, Garchomp, Dragonite, Aegislash, and many more. Since many of these Pokémon carry setup moves, Reflect will offset the incoming physical damage from them, and Foul Play will punish their attempts to set up with Dragon Dance or Swords Dance. Rocky Helmet and Endure are excellent for Mega-Kangaskhan,
    as it will lose 33% of its HP (1/6th for each hit) upon contact and can be used to survive a Parental Bond attack at low health. It's also great to break Focus Sashes or Multiscale. On the other hand, surviving Outrage with Endure can also give you a free switch-in as the opponent gets confused due to fatigue.</p>
    
    <h2>Synergy</h2>
    <p>Uxie's Levitate allows it to switch for free in a predicted Ground-type attack such as Earthquake to preserve Mawile's health.</p>
    <p>Foul Play is resisted by Fighting and Fairy types. Mawile can easily take care of those Pokémon with Play Rough and Iron Head respectively, as well as Pokémon with Justified.</p>
    
    <h2>Threat list</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>Aegislash<img src="../resources/img/gen6-box/681-shield.png"><img src="../resources/img/gen6-box/681-blade.png"></summary>
      <strong>Uxie</strong> can comfortably OHKO Aegislash in its Blade Forme with Foul Play, no matter if it's facing a physical, special or mixed variant! Predicting a Shadow Sneak gives you a free KO and a spectacular amount of momentum in the early game. However, you have to scout its moves and item slot, since a special variant will 2HKO with Shadow Ball and Weakness Policy variants can sweep through your entire team.
      <strong>Mega-Mawile</strong> can revenge kill Aegislash with Sucker Punch, but it has to watch out for King's Shield.

      <summary>Dragonite<img src="../resources/img/gen6-box/149.png"></summary>
      Rocky Helmet will break Multiscale and <strong>Uxie</strong> can 2HKO Dragonite with Foul Play after a Dragon Dance and a broken Multiscale. Setting up a Reflect is necessary, because Outrage can 2HKO Uxie after a Dragon Dance.
      Locking Dragonite into Outrage gives <strong>Mega-Mawile</strong> a free switch-in to set up or clean with Sucker Punch before Dragonite can use Earthquake.

    <details>
      <summary>Excadrill<img src="../resources/img/gen6-box/530.png"></summary>
      <strong>Uxie</strong> has a high chance to 2HKO Excadrill with Foul Play and OHKO if Excadrill sets up with Swords Dance. The low chance of Excadrill surviving is mitigated by the Rocky Helmet recoil.
      Though you have to watch out for Mold Breaker because it lets Excadrill bypass Levitate and use Earthquake without making contact, and Iron Head has a decent chance to flinch. Facing a Sand team means that Sandstorm can slowly wear down Uxie.
      <strong>Mega-Mawile</strong> has a bad matchup since both of its STAB moves are resisted and can be outsped and OHKO'd with Earthquake.
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Garchomp<img src="../resources/img/gen6-box/445.png"></summary>
      If you lead with <strong>Uxie,</strong> play defensively by setting up Reflect, as this is a dangerous Pokémon. If it has Swords Dance, Foul Play and Rocky Helmet recoil will guarantee you a 2HKO. Garchomp can run a variety of items.
      Focus Sashes are rendered useless. Rocky Helmet + Rough Skin variants will take away 29% of your health if you make contact with Foul Play. After that, a +2 Outrage will do enough damage to take you down. So setting up Reflect is important to stay alive.
      <strong>Mega-Mawile</strong> can also switch in if Garchomp is locked into Outrage.
